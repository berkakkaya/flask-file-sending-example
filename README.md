# Flask File Sending Example Project

This project shows an example of file sending operation in Flask.
Also this project includes Blurhash encoding.

Server has two endpoints: `/file` and `/blurhash`.
`/file` endpoint supports `GET` and `POST` methods
which stands for getting and sending file. Only
images with these extensions can be sent: `png`, `jpg` and `jpeg`.
In `/blurhash` endpoint, you can get the Blurhash
encoded image in string. You can use this string to
show the blurry version of the actual image while it's
being downloaded.

*Hope this project helps you, happy coding!*
